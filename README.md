# SynthAid

- Synthetic Data Generation with GANs
     -   Use DCGAN to generate realistic synthetic oral cancer images.
      
     - Augment small datasets with diverse synthetic images to improve model generalization.
      
    - Ensure synthetic images capture detailed pathological variations for better model learning.

1. Synthetic Data Generation
DCGAN – For generating realistic synthetic oral cancer images.
Python – For training and optimizing GAN models.
TensorFlow, PyTorch – Frameworks for implementing and fine-tuning DCGAN.

3.   Segmentation and Classification
U-Net – For precise localization of cancerous regions.
CNN – For classification and feature extraction.
Keras, PyTorch – For training and optimizing segmentation models.

4.  Dataset Creation and Augmentation
Python – For preprocessing and combining real and synthetic images.
OpenCV – For image manipulation and augmentation

5. Model Tuning and Performance Improvement
Focal Loss, Class-Balanced Loss – To handle class imbalance and improve recall.
Active Learning – For continuous model improvement using new data.

6.  Deployment and Explainability
Flask – To create a web-based interface for real-time model interaction.
